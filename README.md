A fresh client app for imgur.
(a personnal account on imgur.com is required).


The login button is on the right of the topbar.
/!\ PLease be aware that you'll need to be logged to access the "My Pics" & "Favorites" views /!\


The app shows 3 views :

- "Home" is where you land at app's launch.
Here you browse the last posts uploaded on imgur.
You can also perform en search for specific subjects, and add any post to your favorites by touching it's little heart icon.

- "My Pics" is where you can see the pictures that you uploaded from your phone's Gallery.
The bottom-left blue "Upload" button allows you to send a new one.

- "Favorites" is where you can retrieve all your favorites.
You can remove them by touching their red cross icon.


We hope you enjoy this app !
